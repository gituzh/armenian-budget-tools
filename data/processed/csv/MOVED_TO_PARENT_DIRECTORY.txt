NOTICE: Processed Data Files Have Been Moved
============================================

The processed data files have been moved one level up to data/processed/

Old location: data/processed/csv/*.csv
New location: data/processed/*.csv

This change was made to better organize the data directory since it contains
multiple file types (CSV, JSON, validation reports), not just CSV files.

File types now in data/processed/:
  - *.csv - Processed budget data files
  - *_overall.json - Overall totals and metadata
  - *_validation.json - Validation reports (JSON format)
  - *_validation.md - Validation reports (Markdown format)

If you have bookmarks or scripts pointing to the old location:
  - Update file paths from data/processed/csv/ to data/processed/
  - Re-run the armenian-budget process command to generate new files
  - Or run the migration script: python scripts/migrate_processed_data.py
